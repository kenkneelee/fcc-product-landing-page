                <ul>
                    <li>Bettas are a tropical fish species native to Thailand that have been selectively bred for
                        aggressiveness, colour, and finnage, resulting in an endless selection of beautiful variants.
                    </li>
                                        <li><u>Basic care!</u> Feed your bettas every 1-2 days and change their water out for fresh,
                        dechlorinated water at least once a week.
                        <li><u>Give them enough space!</u> In the wild, bettas live in large, expansive, but
                        shallow rice paddies throughout Asia and are able to
                        breathe air when water levels are low. Because of this, they can tolerate living in small
                        amounts of water or oxygen-poor environments for short amounts of time. Pet bettas, however, are
                        not
                        subject to weather conditions and should be housed comfortably in adequately sized and heated
                        aquariums!</li>

                    <li><u>Keep them apart!</u> Bettas are extremely territorial and will fight to the death if kept
                        together. The only times bettas should be kept together are: temporarily while under optimal
                        conditions for breeding (which is very likely to leave a fish injured and is only recommended
                        for advanced keepers); or a sorority situation (non-aggressive females kept in ideal conditions
                        with an abundance of hiding spaces). </li>

                    </li>

                <h3>Male Koi Betta</h3>
                Male bettas are generally larger than females, have longer fins and are much more aggressive. Male
                bettas are extremely territorial and should never be kept with other males, or kept with females
                short-term for the purpose of breeding. Otherwise, please house your male bettas SEPARATELY!

                <h3>Female Koi Betta</h3>
                Female bettas are smaller and generally have smaller fins while being less aggressive than males. In
                ideal (heavily planted, large aquariums with many hiding spots) conditions, a few may be kept together
                as a "sorority." Beware though as each individual fish is different, and fights may break out if
                individuals are incompatible!

                <h3>Juvenile (unsexed) Koi Betta</h3>
                Juvenile bettas are young bettas that have not yet grown to the point of sexual maturity and can not be
                differentiated based on sex. In koi bettas, they tend to be translucent and colourless, also known as a
                "cellophane" pattern. As they mature, some koi bettas will stay this colour while others will develop
                magnificent red and black markings.
